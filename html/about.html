        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p> &nbsp; Science UP's focus is to improve undergraduate research by better connecting mentor and mentee. SUP is a web-application that promotes collaboration by integrating schedules, messaging, and document sharing into a unified workspace. 
<br> &nbsp; Our inspiration for SUP comes from personal research experiences. In the lab, some of our team members have noticed a lack in connection with their mentors due to the use of multiple platforms - email, dropbox, text messaging. Files and messages are shared individually on these services, potentially making the research process more difficult due to disorganization. As student researchers, we have identified specific tools that we feel will optimize our time in the lab and connection with our mentors. 
<br> &nbsp; When researchers decide to join the SUP community, they are prompted to create a research space. Each research space is assigned a unique key which allows students and mentors to collaborate on a project. Users are able to access research tools from their dashboards. The "Student Dashboard" features "Check In," "Messaging," and "Documents" tabs. The "Mentor Dashboard" incorporates the same features as the "Student Dashboard" with an additional administrative feature know as the "Student Roster."</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p><b>Check In</b> &nbsp; Integrates the Yo. API to notify mentors in real-time when the student reaches the lab. This is a simple method that pushes a notification to a mentor's mobile device. Mentors will find this useful so that they are aware of when students are working in the lab. 
<br><br><b>Documents</b> &nbsp;  Integrates the Dropbox Saver API to allow users to upload research files to their dropbox. Mentors and students can share lab data, notes, and relevant journal articles seamlessly. 
<br><br><b>Messaging</b> &nbsp; Why use email? They get lost. Messaging is a simpler and direct forum which displays conversation between members of the same lab group. Users are openly able to ask and answer questions, as well as discuss issues regarding the study. Each message is chronologically ordered with the newest messages appearing first. This is a quick and easy way to communicate with everyone in the lab group.
<br><br><b>Student Roster</b> &nbsp; Administrative feature for mentors that displays a list of student profiles associated with their lab group.

        <h2> Experience </h2>
        <p> &nbsp; Because SUP is a web-based application, it is accessible from any device that connects to the internet including desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, and wearable devices. Availability on the go allows users to access their dashboards to use the site no matter where they are. 
<br> &nbsp;<b>Closer teams know what's SUP.</b> Working together promotes a healthier research experience for both mentor and mentee. With the assistance of SUP, connection is better facilitated under the use of one service. 
<br> &nbsp;SUP provides the ultimate student research experience, helping to close the communication gap in the scientific research process between students and mentors. By bringing together team members onto one platform, SUP delivers collaborative datasharing for lab communities.
